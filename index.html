    <p id="dialogue1">According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off of the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.</p>
    <p id="dialogue2">Pretty cool that I can remember all of that, right?</p>
    <p id="dialogue3">Unfortunately, it's... pretty useless, ehe.</p>
    <p id="dialogue4">But I'm still pretty proud I can do that!</p>
    <p id="dialogue5">What do you think? Do you think that it's cool?</p>
    <p id="dialogue6a">Yeah! I'm glad you agree with me!</p>
    <p id="dialogue6b">...O-Oh. Well, that's fair, I guess... ehehe...</p>
    <p id="dialogue7">Regardless, there's more that I can do!</p>
    <p id="dialogue8">Like I work for this one company called DeltaCanine Studios...</p>
    <p id="dialogue9a">They're really cool! Even if they've only made one game!</p>
    <p id="dialogue9b">I think they're really cool...! Even if they've only made, uh... one game.</p>
    <p id="dialogue10">Maybe you've heard of them?</p>
    <p id="dialogue11a">Yeah, yeah! They really are!</p>
    <p id="dialogue11b">Oh, well... that's okay...!</p>
    <p id="dialogue11c">...Oh. I see.</p>
